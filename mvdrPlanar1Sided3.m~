%% STFT 
K = 2^8+1; % Window length in samples. +1 makes the window length odd and symmetric. stft() will either truncate the window by 1, or overlap the 1st and last elements (which are both zero). This means we could consider the window length to be K-1 also depending on whether we would prefer to consider a symmetric or periodic window.
